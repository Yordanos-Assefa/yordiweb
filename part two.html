    <h1>Introduction </h1>
    <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. 
        Vendors in cyber security fields will typically use end point, network and advanced threat protection security as well as data loss prevention.  vendors have become an essential part of many organizations’ business operations.<br> While working with vendors can help you deliver value to customers, they also pose a significant cyber risk. Vendors tend to have access to critical systems and company data which, if mismanaged, can expose your organization to cyber threats.
    </br>This is why it is crucial that you conduct vendor cybersecurity due diligence. One way to do so is through the use of vendor due diligence questionnaires.<br> Posing questions about a vendor’s cybersecurity practices will help you better understand the potential risks they present to your organization. Understanding when to use cybersecurity questionnaires and knowing the right questions to ask will allow you to streamline the due diligence process and better assess vendor risk.<br>
